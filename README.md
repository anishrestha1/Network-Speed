Network Speed

I used Speedtest package for testing the Downloading and uploading speed in Mbps. 
Speedtest is a relative value used for determining the lowest latency server for performing the actual speed test against. There is the potential for this tool to report results inconsistent with Speedtest.net.
I used tabulate package to make a table that shows the detail of the information.
